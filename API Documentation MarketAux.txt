Sentiment is between -1 and +1. Anything 0 = neutral, above 0 = positive, below 0 = negative. The higher or lower the sentiment score the more positive or negative it is identified as.
sentiment_lte	false	Use this to find all articles with entities with a sentiment_score of less than or equal to x.

filter_entities	false	By default all entities for each article are returned - by setting this to true, only the relevant entities to your query will be returned with each article. For example, if you set symbols=TSLA and filter_entities=true, only "TSLA" entities will be returned with the articles.
Default: false
must_have_entities	false	By default all articles are returned, set this to true to ensure that at least one entity has been identified within the article.

* at the end of a term signifies a prefix query
( and ) signify precedence
To use one of these characters literally, escape it with a preceding backslash (\).
This searches the full body of the text and the title.

Example: "ipo" -nyse (searches for articles which must include the string "ipo" but articles must NOT mention NYSE.)

Entity Stats (time series) Available on: Standard and above
Endpoint
GET https://api.marketaux.com/v1/entity/stats/intraday HTTP/1.1
Get an intraday view of how well entities performed over different intervals using this endpoint. Find the best or worst performing entities broken down to every minute, hour, day, week, month, quarter or year. Useful for comparing entities and creating graphs and charts

Adding symbols to the request is not necessary - by default all of the best performing stocks are returned. Filter entities by symbols, exchanges, industries, countries, entity types and more.

HTTP GET Parameters
name	required	description
api_token	true	Your API token which can be found on your account dashboard.
interval	false	The interval of the time series.

Options: minute | hour | day | week | month | quarter | year
Default: day
Example: interval=day

Note: there are restrictions on the maximum time frame for each interval. This is based on the published_before parameter. From the published_before date specified, the maximum time frame that can be retrieved is as following:

minute = 7 days
hour = 1 month
day = 3 years
week = 5 years
month = 5 years
quarter = 10 years
year = 10 years

By default the maximum allowed time frame will be applied. If the time frame is exceeded by the date parameters provided, the default will be applied - no error will be thrown.

For example, if interval=minute and published_before=2021-01-10, the max that can be returned will be back to 2021-01-03. You can specify a published_after value to reduce this time frame if necessary (e.g. published_after=2021-01-08).
group_by	false	Group results by symbol | exchange | industry | country

sentiment_lte	false	Use this to refine results to find all documents for entities with a sentiment_score less than or equal to x.
Example: sentiment_lte=0 - this will find all document entities which are neutral or negative

- negates a single token
" wraps a number of tokens to signify a phrase for searching
* at the end of a term signifies a prefix query
( and ) signify precedence
To use one of these characters literally, escape it with a preceding backslash (\).
