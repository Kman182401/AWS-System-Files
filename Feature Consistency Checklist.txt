Feature Consistency Checklist for Live Market Data

1. Add a print statement at the end of your market feature engineering function (e.g., generate_features):
   print(features.columns)
   - This will output the exact list of feature names being generated for each ticker.

2. Run your pipeline for a real market ticker (not news).
   - Look for the output in your terminal that shows the feature columns.

3. Copy the list of feature names from the output (everything inside the square brackets [...]).

4. At the end of your feature engineering function, enforce column order:
   feature_columns = [list of feature names from step 3]
   for col in feature_columns:
       if col not in features:
           features[col] = np.nan
   features = features[feature_columns]
   return features

5. In your pipeline, after feature engineering for each ticker, add an assertion:
   assert list(features.columns) == feature_columns, f"Feature mismatch for {ticker}: {list(features.columns)}"

6. If you get an assertion error, investigate and fix any inconsistencies in your feature engineering logic.

7. (Optional) Update your config files to ensure all tickers use the same feature set.

8. Once you confirm feature consistency, remove or comment out the print statements.

This process ensures your ML and RL models always receive the same features, in the same order, for every tickerâ€”critical for robust, production-grade trading.

Steps to WAIT on until you have live market data:

1. Extract the exact list of feature names from your real market data after running feature engineering.
2. Enforce column order at the end of your feature function using the real feature list.
3. Add feature consistency assertions in your pipeline using the real feature list.
4. Update any config files or model code that depend on the final, real feature set.
